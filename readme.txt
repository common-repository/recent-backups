== Description ==

Recent Backups sits alongside a standard BackUpWordPress installation. It adds a widget to the dashboard that displays the contents of the backup folder in chronological order. Links are provided so users can easily download individual backups and store them offline. A button is also displayed so users can launch a fresh backup from the dashboard.

BackUpWordPress offers a powerful, free and simple, zero configuration backup solution for WordPress users. You can download BackUpWordPress via http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backupwordpress/.

You can choose to show or hide this widget from certain users through the use of the Adminimize plugin. You can download Adminimize via http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adminimize/.



== Installation ==

This plugin follows the standard WordPress installation method. Simply put it in your plugin's folder readily unzipped, or upload it through the WordPress backend. Easy as pie. Sweet, sweet delicious pie.



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are You affiliated with BackUpWordPress? =

Not at all. It just seems like a really simple backup solution and the functionality of this plugin achieves something I wanted.

= So your taking responsibility for my backups? =

Woah there Jimmy. Your backups are your responsibility. I'm no programmer. I simply pulled together the necessary code with some help from Google and the folks at StackOverflow.com. I don't take any responsibility if your website crashes / explodes or gets taken over by ninjas.
